Your completed pipeline will accept raw audio as input and return a predicted transcription of the spoken language.  The full pipeline is summarized in the figure below.\n","\n","<img src=\"images/pipeline.png\">\n","\n","- **STEP 1** is a pre-processing step that converts raw audio to one of two feature representations that are commonly used for ASR. \n","- **STEP 2** is an acoustic model which accepts audio features as input and returns a probability distribution over all potential transcriptions. After learning about the basic types of neural networks that are often used for acoustic modeling, you will engage in your own investigations, to design your own acoustic model!\n","- **STEP 3** in the pipeline takes the output from the acoustic model and returns a predicted transcription.  \n","\n","Feel free to use the links below to navigate the notebook:\n","- [The Data](#thedata)\n","- [**STEP 1**](#step1): Acoustic Features for Speech Recognition\n","- [**STEP 2**](#step2): Deep Neural Networks for Acoustic Modeling\n","    - [Model 0](#model0): RNN\n","    - [Model 1](#model1): RNN + TimeDistributed Dense\n","    - [Model 2](#model2): CNN + RNN + TimeDistributed Dense\n","    - [Model 3](#model3): Deeper RNN + TimeDistributed Dense\n","    - [Model 4](#model4): Bidirectional RNN + TimeDistributed Dense\n","    - [Models 5+](#model5)\n","    - [Compare the Models](#compare)\n","    - [Final Model](#final)\n","- [**STEP 3**](#step3): Obtain Predictions\n","\n","<a id='thedata'></a>\n","## The Data\n","\n","We begin by investigating the dataset that will be used to train and evaluate your pipeline.  [LibriSpeech](http://www.danielpovey.com/files/2015_icassp_librispeech.pdf) is a large corpus of English-read speech, designed for training and evaluating models for ASR.  The dataset contains 1000 hours of speech derived from audiobooks.  We will work with a small subset in this project, since larger-scale data would take a long while to train.  However, after completing this project, if you are interested in exploring further, you are encouraged to work with more of the data that is provided [online](http://www.openslr.org/12/).\n","\n","In the code cells below, you will use the `vis_train_features` module to visualize a training example.  The supplied argument `index=0` tells the module to extract the first example in the training set.  (You are welcome to change `index=0` to point to a different training example, if you like, but please **DO NOT** amend any other code in the cell.)  The returned variables are:\n","- `vis_text` - transcribed text (label) for the training example.\n","- `vis_raw_audio` - raw audio waveform for the training example.\n","- `vis_mfcc_feature` - mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) for the training example.\n","- `vis_spectrogram_feature` - spectrogram for the training example. \n","- `vis_audio_path` - the file path to the training example."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\"\"\"\n","Defines a class that is used to featurize audio clips, and provide\n","them to the network for training or testing.\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","import json\n","import numpy as np\n","import random\n","from python_speech_features import mfcc\n","import librosa\n","import scipy.io.wavfile as wav\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import make_axes_locatable\n","\n","\n","\n","RNG_SEED = 123\n","\n","class AudioGenerator():\n","    def __init__(self, step=10, window=20, max_freq=8000, mfcc_dim=13,\n","        minibatch_size=20, desc_file=None, spectrogram=True, max_duration=10.0, \n","        sort_by_duration=False):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Params:\n","            step (int): Step size in milliseconds between windows (for spectrogram ONLY)\n","            window (int): FFT window size in milliseconds (for spectrogram ONLY)\n","            max_freq (int): Only FFT bins corresponding to frequencies between\n","                [0, max_freq] are returned (for spectrogram ONLY)\n","            desc_file (str, optional): Path to a JSON-line file that contains\n","                labels and paths to the audio files.

Instead, we provide code that first performs a pre-processing step to convert the raw audio to a feature representation that has historically proven successful for ASR models.  Your acoustic model will accept the feature representation as input.\n","\n","In this project, you will explore two possible feature representations.  _After completing the project_, if you'd like to read more about deep learning architectures that can accept raw audio input, you are encouraged to explore this [research paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a566/cd4a8623d661a4931814d9dffc72ecbf63c4.pdf).\n","\n","### Spectrograms\n","\n","The first option for an audio feature representation is the [spectrogram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FatxGN3vAM).

The implementation appears in the `utils.py` file in your repository.\n","\n","The code that we give you returns the spectrogram as a 2D tensor, where the first (_vertical_) dimension indexes time, and the second (_horizontal_) dimension indexes frequency.  To speed the convergence of your algorithm, we have also normalized the spectrogram.

If you'd like to peek at the implementation details, look at the `add_ctc_loss` function within the `train_utils.py` file in the repository.\n","\n","To train your architecture, you will use the `train_model` function within the `train_utils` module; it has already been imported in one of the above code cells.  The `train_model` function takes three **required** arguments:\n","- `input_to_softmax` - a Keras model instance.\n","- `pickle_path` - the name of the pickle file where the loss history will be saved.\n","- `save_model_path` - the name of the HDF5 file where the model will be saved.\n","\n","If we have already supplied values for `input_to_softmax`, `pickle_path`, and `save_model_path`, please **DO NOT** modify these values. \n","\n","There are several **optional** arguments that allow you to have more control over the training process.  You are welcome to, but not required to, supply your own values for these arguments.\n","- `minibatch_size` - the size of the minibatches that are generated while training the model (default: `20`).\n","- `spectrogram` - Boolean value dictating whether spectrogram (`True`) or MFCC (`False`) features are used for training (default: `True`).\n","- `mfcc_dim` - the size of the feature dimension to use when generating MFCC features (default: `13`).\n","- `optimizer` - the Keras optimizer used to train the model (default: `SGD(lr=0.02, decay=1e-6, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True, clipnorm=5)`).  \n","- `epochs` - the number of epochs to use to train the model (default: `20`).  If you choose to modify this parameter, make sure that it is *at least* 20.\n","- `verbose` - controls the verbosity of the training output in the `model.fit_generator` method (default: `1`).\n","- `sort_by_duration` - Boolean value dictating whether the training and validation sets are sorted by (increasing) duration before the start of the first epoch (default: `False`).\n","\n","The `train_model` function defaults to using spectrogram features; if you choose to use these features, note that the acoustic model in `simple_rnn_model` should have `input_dim=161`.

If you would like to experiment with `LSTM` or `SimpleRNN` cells, feel free to do so here.  If you change the `GRU` units to `SimpleRNN` cells in `simple_rnn_model`, you may notice that the loss quickly becomes undefined (`nan`) - you are strongly encouraged to check this for yourself!

While your final acoustic model should not be identical to any of the architectures explored above, you are welcome to merely combine the explored layers above into a deeper architecture.  It is **NOT** necessary to include new layer types that were not explored in the notebook.\n","\n","However, if you would like some ideas for even more layer types, check out these ideas for some additional, optional extensions to your model:\n","\n","- If you notice your model is overfitting to the training dataset, consider adding **dropout**!  To add dropout to [recurrent layers](https://faroit.github.io/keras-docs/1.0.2/layers/recurrent/), pay special attention to the `dropout_W` and `dropout_U` arguments.  This [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05287) may also provide some interesting theoretical background.\n","- If you choose to include a convolutional layer in your model, you may get better results by working with **dilated convolutions**.  If you choose to use dilated convolutions, make sure that you are able to accurately calculate the length of the acoustic model's output in the `model.output_length` lambda function.  You can read more about dilated convolutions in Google's [WaveNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499).  For an example of a speech-to-text system that makes use of dilated convolutions, check out this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/buriburisuri/speech-to-text-wavenet).  You can work with dilated convolutions [in Keras](https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/) by paying special attention to the `padding` argument when you specify a convolutional layer.\n","- If your model makes use of convolutional layers, why not also experiment with adding **max pooling**?  Check out [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.02720.pdf) for example architecture that makes use of max pooling in an acoustic model.\n","- So far, you have experimented with a single bidirectional RNN layer.  Consider stacking the bidirectional layers, to produce a [deep bidirectional RNN](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/asru_2013.pdf)!\n","\n","All models that you specify in this repository should have `output_length` defined as an attribute.  This attribute is a lambda function that maps the (temporal) length of the input acoustic features to the (temporal) length of the output softmax layer.  This function is used in the computation of CTC loss; to see this, look at the `add_ctc_loss` function in `train_utils.py`.  To see where the `output_length` attribute is defined for the models in the code, take a look at the `sample_models.py` file.  You will notice this line of code within most models:\n","```\n","model.output_length = lambda x: x\n","```\n","The acoustic model that incorporates a convolutional layer (`cnn_rnn_model`) has a line that is a bit different:\n","```\n","model.output_length = lambda x: cnn_output_length(\n","        x, kernel_size, conv_border_mode, conv_stride)\n","```\n","\n","In the case of models that use purely recurrent layers, the lambda function is the identity function, as the recurrent layers do not modify the (temporal) length of their input tensors.  However, convolutional layers are more complicated and require a specialized function (`cnn_output_length` in `sample_models.py`) to determine the temporal length of their output.\n","\n","You will have to add the `output_length` attribute to your final model before running the code cell below.  Feel free to use the `cnn_output_length` function, if it suits your model.
